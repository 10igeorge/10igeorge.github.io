    <h3>Really terrible websites I've created!</h3>
      <p>
        During our first week at Epicodus, we've learned some programming basics including:
        <ol>
          <li>Basic inline and block elements</li>
          <li>Setting up and using git</li>
          <li>Media-specific elements</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        These are only a few of the many things we have learned. In addition to the basics, we have also built several websites. Let's take it back to the early 2000's...
